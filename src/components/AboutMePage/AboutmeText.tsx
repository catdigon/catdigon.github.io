                        <Card.Text>
                            I live by the sea in Figueira da Foz, Portugal.
                            My path into design grew from a background in research, documentary cinema, theatre, and education.

                        <Card.Text>
                            I began in the arts, fascinated by how creativity can bring people together.
                            I once dreamed of directing films, but editing captured me - the structures, rhythmas, and problem-solving behind every story.
                            That same love for structure and intention eventually led me to design.

                        <Card.Text>
                            My approach blends curiosity, creative chaos, and structured research.
                            I start with a question, explore perspectives, and shape responses based on what I discover - not assumptions.
                        </Card.Text>

                        <Card.Text>
                            I believe design, like art, should listen before it speaks.
                            The workd isn't made for a few - it's shaped by all of us, together.
